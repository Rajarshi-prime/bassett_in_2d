1. Identify co-rotating vortices--> VVI
2. What is the average lifetime for a corotating vortex? 
3. How often do you find co-rotating vortex? How many pairs? 
 	* Timeseries of number of co-rotating pairs. 
4. how is preferential clustering affected by basset? 
	#1 W/o bassett only finite density ratio
	#2 all terms of finite density ratio
5. Is particle clustering happeing due to presence of attractor. 
6. How is the statistics temporal evolution affected by basset?
